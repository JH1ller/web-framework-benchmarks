# web-framework-benchmarks

Web projects created in the context of my bachelor thesis about server side web framework performances. 

Basic implementations of a blog app + benchmarking tests for Express, Django &amp; Flask.

Stress tests were conducted using the [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) HTTP benchmarking tool.
